Multi-Indicator Strategy - Pine Script
The Multi-Indicator Strategy is a robust trading algorithm developed in Pine Script for use in TradingView. This strategy combines multiple technical indicators to analyze market trends, momentum, and breakouts while incorporating advanced risk management techniques. It is highly customizable, making it suitable for a variety of trading styles and asset classes, including stocks, forex, and cryptocurrencies.

Key Features:
Moving Averages and Bollinger Bands:

The strategy uses both short-term and long-term moving averages to identify trend direction.
Bollinger Bands are calculated to detect price breakouts by comparing price movements with upper and lower thresholds derived from standard deviations.
Momentum Indicators:

The RSI (Relative Strength Index) helps identify overbought and oversold conditions, signaling potential reversals.
The stochastic oscillator pinpoints short-term momentum shifts using crossover signals.
MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) is used to confirm bullish or bearish momentum.
Trend Indicators:

Donchian Channels identify breakout points by tracking the highest high and lowest low over a specified period.
The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) confirms overbought or oversold conditions and overall momentum.
Risk Management:

Stop-loss and take-profit levels can be configured to manage downside risk and lock in gains.
A trailing stop-loss feature adjusts dynamically to protect profits as the trade progresses.
How It Works:
The strategy generates buy and sell signals based on specific conditions triggered by the indicators:

Buy Signals:

Price crossing above the upper Bollinger Band.
Moving average crossovers, with the short-term average moving above the long-term average.
RSI indicating oversold conditions with potential for reversal.
Donchian channel breakouts, where price exceeds a calculated percentage of the channel.
MACD and CCI bullish crossovers to confirm momentum.
Sell Signals:

Price crossing below the lower Bollinger Band.
Stochastic oscillator indicating bearish crossovers.
MACD bearish signals or CCI overbought crossovers.
Donchian channel reversals.
To optimize performance, the script allows users to customize the length of indicators, thresholds for overbought/oversold conditions, and risk parameters. These settings make the strategy flexible for different trading approaches, such as scalping, swing trading, or long-term investing.

Purpose and Usage:
This strategy is ideal for backtesting and analyzing historical performance across various asset classes. It provides insights into market trends, helps traders evaluate potential entry and exit points, and enhances decision-making through multi-indicator confirmations. By combining trend-following and momentum-based signals with robust risk management, the strategy is designed to balance profitability and risk.
